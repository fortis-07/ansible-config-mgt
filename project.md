   ```
   ![- **Screenshot**](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/add%20the%20pivate%20key%20and%20confirm%20that%20it%20has%20been%20added.PNG)


## SSH Connection Using `.pem` Key

If you encounter issues with `id_dsa` and receive a `Permission denied (public key)` error, follow these steps to use your `.pem` key instead:

1. **Start the SSH Agent**  
   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent -s)
   ```
   Output example:
   ```
   Agent pid 599
   ```

2. **Add the `.pem` Key**  
   Replace `<path-to-pem-file>` with the location of your `.pem` file (e.g., `C:\Users\PrinceTee\Downloads\lampproject.pem`).
   ```bash
   ssh-add "<path-to-pem-file>"
   ```

3. **Verify the Key Added**  
   List the keys added to the SSH agent to ensure your `.pem` file is included:
   ```bash
   ssh-add -l
   ```
   This should display the fingerprint of the `.pem` key.

4. **Test the SSH Connection**  
   Replace `<your-public-ip>` with the public IP address of your Jenkins-Ansible instance:
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@<your-public-ip>
   ```


## Update and Push Changes to GitHub

1. Add and commit the changes to Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up Ansible directory structure and development inventory"
   ```

## Verify Jenkins Automation (if Integrated with Jenkins)

1. **Jenkins Build Trigger**  
   If Jenkins is set to trigger a job on code changes, it will automatically start a build once your code is merged into the master branch.

   ![*(Screenshot)*](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/jenkins%20was%20automatically%20updated%20for%20build%20when%20we%20pushed%20changes%20to%20main%20branch.PNG)

2. **Confirm Build Artifacts on Jenkins**  
   - Log into Jenkins and navigate to your project.
   - After the job runs, confirm the build output is saved in `/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/`.

   ![*(Screenshot)*](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/confirm%20the%20build%20is%20saved%20in%20the%20directory%20var%20jenkins.PNG)


## Connect to Your Ansible-Controlled Server from VSCode

1. **Open VSCode**  
   Start VSCode on your local machine.

2. **Connect to Your Remote Instance**  
   - Use the Remote - SSH extension in VSCode.
   - Press `F1`, type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`, and select your server (e.g., `51.21.47.126`).  
   - Choose your operating system (Linux, Windows, or macOS). For this setup, select **Linux**.

   

3. **Handle SSH Permission Errors**  
   If you encounter a "permission denied (publickey)" error, update your SSH config file to include your SSH key:
   ```bash
   IdentityFile "C:\Users\Prince-Tee\Downloads\lampproject.pem"
   ```
   ![*(Screenshot)*](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/update%20the%20config%20file%20to%20the%20ssh%20key.PNG)

4. **Reconnect to the Host**  
   After updating, press `F1`, type `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`, and select the server. Confirm the SSH connection in the terminal and you will see that we can now connect to our server on vscode.

## Prepare the Ansible Environment

1. **Navigate to Your Ansible Directory**  
   - Once connected to the server through VSCode, open the terminal.
   - Go to your Ansible configuration directory where playbooks and inventory files are located:
     ```bash
     cd ~/ansible-config-mgt
     ```

2. **Confirm Inventory and Playbook Locations**  
   Check that `inventory/dev.ini` and `playbooks/common.yml` are present:
   ```bash
   ls inventory/dev.ini playbooks/common.yml
   ```
    ![*(Screenshot)*](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/confirm%20the%20build%20is%20saved%20in%20the%20directory%20var%20jenkins.PNG)

   - If these files are not present, pull them from your repository:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

   ![*(Screenshot)*](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/Prepare%20the%20Ansible%20Environment.PNG)



   - **Permission Issues**:  
     If you encounter permission issues, ensure your AWS security group allows SSH access from the Ansible server’s private IP, not `0.0.0.0/0`, for added security.
   
   ![*(Screenshot)*](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/update%20all%20teh%20servers%20with%20ansible%20private%20ip.PNG)

3. **Run the Ansible Playbook**  
   Run the playbook with the following command:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/dev.ini playbooks/common.yml
   ```

   ![*(Screenshot)* ](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/run%20the%20final%20commandncommand.PNG)  


If you encounter the below error
![Screenshot](https://github.com/Prince-Tee/AnsibleConfigMgt/blob/main/screenshot%20from%20my%20local%20env/error%20encoutered.PNG)

It means Ansible is trying to manage a server that uses apt (Ubuntu/Debian package manager) with a task configured for yum (typically used by RHEL/CentOS systems). Since your playbook likely includes a package installation task for wireshark or similar, 
and it’s incorrectly assuming yum instead of apt. so change the content of your dev.ini file to the below to allow the download of the package

```bash
---
- name: update web, nfs, and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version on RHEL/CentOS servers
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest
      when: ansible_facts['pkg_mgr'] == "yum"

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repository
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_facts['pkg_mgr'] == "apt"

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version on Ubuntu/Debian servers
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest
      when: ansible_facts['pkg_mgr'] == "apt"
```
After that run the playbook again.

4. **Verify Installation**  
   You can confirm Wireshark installation on each server by running:
   ```bash
   which wireshark
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   wireshark --version
   ```

 **Conclusion**
 In this Ansible configuration management setup, we successfully automated the process of managing infrastructure through Jenkins and GitHub. The steps covered include setting up Ansible on the Jenkins EC2 instance, configuring Jenkins for automated builds and artifact archiving, and establishing a GitHub webhook to trigger builds upon code updates. The structured approach includes setting up a branch and directory organization within GitHub, creating a robust Ansible inventory, and configuring SSH for secure server access. Overall, this setup enables streamlined configuration management and efficient infrastructure provisioning, making it a practical foundation for further automation.
